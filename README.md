This project includes an agent–based SIR model to simulate the transmission of viral vectors within a community.

##  Key features of this project :: 
#### It implements a comparison based simulation in two situations with some constraints that represent mitigation policies which includes-
#####           mask wearing
#####           social distancing 
#####           sanitary hygiene etc.       
#### It analyzes a viral pandemic situation like Covid – 19 using the real data.
#### It also visualizes the simulation using various libraries available in python.
